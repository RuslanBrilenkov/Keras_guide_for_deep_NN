# Keras_guide_for_deep_NN
In this repository, I am showing a step-by-step guide on how to create a custom deep NN using Keras, a high-level neural network API, which is based on Tensorflow.

Firstly, we will learn how to load a famous cifar dataset. Secondly, we look into different types of the deep neural network (NN) architechtures, such as sequential and functional.
