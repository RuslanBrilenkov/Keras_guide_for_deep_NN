# Keras_guide_for_deep_NN

## Exploring and experimenting with various types of Neural Networks 
## Classic NN, convolutional CNN, and improved CNN.

I created this project for several reasons:

1. to classify images by their types using state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) library, Keras;
2. to explore various types of neural networks on hands-on examples;
2. to explain the neural networks (NN) in Keras in intuitive way;
3. to create a baseline guide for everyone interested in learning about deep NN.

In other words, this project may be considered as a step-by-step guide for building custom NN using Kerasa high-level neural network API, (with a TensorFlow backend).

## This project consists of 3 complete parts:
### Part 1. Building classic NN
### Part 2. Building convolutional CNN
### Part 3. Greatly improving CNN performance
