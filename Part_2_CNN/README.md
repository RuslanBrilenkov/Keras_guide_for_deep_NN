# Keras_guide_for_deep_NN

## This is Part 2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

In this repository, I am showing a step-by-step guide on how to create a custom CNN using Keras, a high-level neural network API, which is based on Tensorflow.

Firstly, we will learn how to load a famous cifar dataset. Secondly, we look into different types of CNN elements, such as filters, strides, padding.

Practically, in this guide, I walk you through the following steps:
1. Importing the necessary libraries;
2. Loading and pre-processing our first data set (CIFAR-10); 
3. Deciding on NN architecture with detailed explanation of the possibilities;
4. Compiling our model;
5. Training our model;
6. Evaluating our model;
7. (Bonus) visualisation of our model.

In conclusions, I discuss the causes of differences n performance evaluation between classic NN (previous Part 1) and current CNN. 

In the next Part 3, I implement the discussed improvements, such as batch normalisation and dropout layers.
