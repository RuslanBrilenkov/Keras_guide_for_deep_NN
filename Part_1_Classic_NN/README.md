# Keras_guide_for_deep_NN
In this repository, I am showing a step-by-step guide on how to create a custom deep NN using Keras, a high-level neural network API, which is based on Tensorflow.

Firstly, we will learn how to load a famous cifar dataset. Secondly, we look into different types of the deep neural network (NN) architectures, such as sequential and functional.

Practically, in this guide, I walk you through the following steps:
1. Importing the necessary libraries;
2. Loading and pre-processing our first data set (CIFAR-10); 
3. Deciding on NN architecture with detailed explanation of the possibilities;
4. Compiling our model;
5. Training our model;
6. Evaluating our model;
7. (Bonus) visualisation of our model.

In the next Part 2, I build a convolutional neural network (CNN) from scratch in Keras, explain the architecture differences and elements, and compare the performance evaluation with this current classic NN.
